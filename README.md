This is a starter theme based on [Underscores](http://underscores.me/) with scss structure is improved and use Bootstrap 3 framework.

Getting Started
---------------

Download `theme-name` from GitHub. The first thing you want to do is copy the `theme-name` directory and change the name to something else (like, say, `megatherium-is-awesome`), and then you'll need to do some steps.

1. Change theme information in `style.css` file
2. Search for: `theme-name-` and replace with: `megatherium-is-awesome-`
3. Search for: `theme_name_` and replace with: `megatherium_is_awesome_`
4. Search for: `Theme_Name` and replace with: `Megatherium_Is_Awesome`
5. Search for: `'theme-name'` and replace with: `'megatherium-is-awesome'`
6. Search for: `Theme Name` and replace with: `Megatherium Is Awesome`
7. Update the links in `footer.php` with your own information
8. Next, update or delete this readme

Now you're ready to go! The next step is easy to say, but harder to do: make an awesome WordPress theme. :)

Good luck!
